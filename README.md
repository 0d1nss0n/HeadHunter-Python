  Command and Control Server (C2)
  Author: Logan Goins

## Notes
This software receives and handles a reverse shell connection, giving the operator of the (C&C) server access to the infected zombie device. 

Future features include:


1. A more featureful payload (The current payload is just a simple and rather bland reverse shell connection). This would include beaconing, file transfer, persistance methods, and more. As well as a dedicated windows payload, as the currently payload is untested on Windows as the server is intended to be for GNU/Linux based operating systems
2. Encryption for server/payload communcation
3. An installer that creates bash script to mimic a binary on path. HeadHunter could be run from any directory
4. The ability to command multiple connected sessions
5. Compatibility with netcat connections. This requires another thread just for reading data and printing output from the zombie to stdout


I am not liable for any damage caused by this software. This software is for educational purposes only. This software is under the discretion of the end user.

## Use Guide

1. Clone the HeadHunter source

```git clone https://github.com/Lionskey/HeadHunter```

2. Change into source directory

```cd HeadHunter```

3. Execute main file

```python3 headhunter.py```

For Windows binaries/executables I recommend auto-py-to-exe or pyinstaller to convert the payload to an executable. Make sure to change the attacker connect back address in the payload before compilation.

  Command and Control Server (C2)

## Notes
This software receives and handles a reverse shell connection, giving the operator of the (C&C) server access to the infected zombie device. 

Future features include:


1. A more featureful payload (The current payload is just a simple and rather bland reverse shell connection). This would include beaconing, file transfer, persistance methods, and more. As well as a dedicated windows payload, as the currently payload is untested on Windows as the server is intended to be for GNU/Linux based operating systems
2. Encryption for server/payload communcation
3. An installer that creates bash script to mimic a binary on path. HeadHunter will be runnable from any directory
4. The ability to command multiple connected sessions
